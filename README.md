Time Hopper is a horde-like exciting game, which incorporates the best qualities found in other games in the genre, reworking their weaknesses and bringing in extra concepts.

Captain Wayde is a time traveler from 2212, that, while on a routine time trip to search for anomalies, gets stuck in a time loop. In an attempt to exit this time loop, the captain decides to try building a new portal inside his ship but lacks the materials needed in order to power it. He then goes to several different locations in space and time to find the materials to power up this gateway. Will he find the solution he’s looking for once he powers it up?

# Gameplay

## Goal

Time Hopper is a grinding game. This being said, there is no limitations in terms of gameplay durability and replayability. The player gets rewarded everytime he gets an upgrade and can set goals of his own to reach a determined power leve. Lorewise, the main goal of the game is to unlock the Rumble Arena, which is a special arena that brings together all of the other game arenas. In order to do so, the player has to collect different currencies from the other arenas, fighting his way through hordes of enemies and defeating bosses in epic fights.

## Basic Gameplay

The player can perform the following actions:

- **Move** - The player can move in the different scenarios using the WASD keys on a keyboard. The player’s movement speed depends on other actions he can perform (for example, walking while aiming or reloading a gun is slower).
- **Jump** - The player can jump by pressing the spacebar.
- **Shooting** - The player can shoot their weapons by pressing MOUSE1 and aim down sights by using MOUSE2.
- **Reload** - The player can reload weapons by pressing the ‘R’ key. However, reloading is only possible if the player has spare ammo to reload and the current magazine is not full.
- **Melee Attack** - The player can perform a melee attack by pressing the ‘V’ key. The attack consists of throwing a punch.

## Enemies

There are three "small" types of enemies and one boss. Enemies spawn in their respective arena and in the Rumble Arena and have different behaviours and attacks. The boss spawns in every arena but the Rumble arena, every 5 rounds. All enemies take more damage if hit on the head compared to the body.
